        <span>&emsp;What platform we use for our data software?</span><br>
        <p>Our KDHW Pharmacy uses the Oracle Apex platform to operate our pharmacy inventory software. It's a user-friendly, low-code platform that's fast and efficient, saving developers time.
            As it is low-code, the developer feel more confortable using it to develop the software, making database process quick and 
            effecient for his/her need base on the demand of the organization.
        </p>
        <span>&emsp;What Special Skill need for developer?</span><br>
        <p>The developers need intermediate IT skills and proficiency in English to build software, fix bugs, as the platform is primarily in English.</p>
        <span>&emsp;What do we need to do regularly with our database process?</span>
        <p>Based on Oracle's updates, we must ensure the necessary data flow and a great user experience to make people more tech-savvy.</p>

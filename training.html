        <p>Our central team offers training programs aimed at improving knowledge about using pharmacy management 
            software effectively. The training focuses on understanding how to utilize the software efficiently and
             how to maintain and analyze data, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency of our pharmacy management 
             system to meet our goals. We provide two types of training: in-person sessions and online courses. 
             These training opportunities are available for our field data staff, ensuring that they have the 
             necessary skills to handle our data management processes effectively. Additionally, we follow up 
             with our staff regularly after the training to provide ongoing support and guidance, ensuring that
              our pharmacy management remains optimized and effective.

            Our Central also provide the coordination meeting to our field staff to manage their pharmacy data nicely and 
            to improve the correction of the data management. We know that without coordination, the field staff will have 
            some gaps during data management and it will some how negatively effect our pharmacy data and recording quality.
        </p>

            The coordination usually focus on the main person of field level staff in order to manage their staff as related
            and regular monitoring the senior management staff toward the central level. We see the result of coordination as 
            a good stratergy to improve our task toward our organization goal.
